This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you should run:

### `npm install`

To install all dependancies.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

**Note that you will need a Spotify Premium account to access the app's full functionality.**

### `npx cypress open`

Opens up Cypress. Navigate to e2e and select the spec test to run it.

### Using the App

Once running in your localhost3000 browser, simply click the "Login to Spotify" button to be redirected to Spotify's login page. Enter your credentials and you will arrive at the Synesthesia dashboard. 

Search for whatever song you like, and watch the cube move around the screen based on the tempo, danceability, and energy of the song!

If you receive a "No playback device found" alert when selecting a song, refreshing the page and waiting around ~10 seconds to allow Spotify to recognize your device may fix the issue.

Have fun!
